1. Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a personal project that aims to learn the current cut pipeline
in ACT written by Loic and Rolando by re-organizing them into a
different framework called todloop which I wrote for the frb studies.
In the process I will try to add documentations as much as I can to
make the codes intelligible.
